## Leveraging Existing Components

The hackathon platform will utilize several existing NixOS Control Center components:

1. __Container Manager__: We'll extend this to handle participant project deployments with resource limits and isolation
2. __Homelab Manager__: We'll adapt its fetch/create workflow for hackathon template management
3. __System Logger__: We'll integrate with this for centralized logging of hackathon activities

## Technical Architecture

Here's a detailed architecture diagram for the hackathon platform:

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (2-3 weeks)

1. __Base Module Setup__

   - Create the hackathon-manager feature structure
   - Integrate with system-config.nix for feature activation
   - Set up PostgreSQL database schema for users, projects, and hackathons



### Phase 2: User Interfaces (2-3 weeks)

1. __Admin Dashboard__

   - Create React-based admin interface with authentication
   - Implement hackathon CRUD operations
   - Add participant and project management views
   - Develop monitoring dashboards

2. __Participant Portal__

   - Build registration and login functionality
   - Create project submission workflow
   - Implement project status and logs viewing
   - Add team management features

3. __API Development__

   - Develop FastAPI backend with JWT authentication
   - Create endpoints for all required operations
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Add validation and error handling

### Phase 3: Automation & Monitoring (1-2 weeks)

1. __Deployment Automation__

   - Create automatic build pipeline for projects
   - Implement GitHub integration for code fetching
   - Add deployment hooks and status updates

2. __Monitoring Setup__

   - Configure Prometheus metrics collection
   - Set up Grafana dashboards for system and project monitoring
   - Implement alerting for resource limits and issues

3. __Cleanup & Lifecycle__

   - Develop time-based resource management
   - Implement automatic cleanup of unused resources
   - Create backup and export functionality

## Configuration Integration

The hackathon platform will be configurable through the existing system-config.nix structure:
