{"concept": "How does NixOS handle hardware configuration?", "explanation": "[Hardware Configuration] NixOS manages hardware through hardware-configuration.nix, which is generated during installation and contains: 1) Device-specific settings, 2) File system configurations, 3) Boot loader settings, 4) Hardware module loading. This file can be customized for specific needs.", "examples": ["Basic hardware setup", "Custom configurations"], "references": ["Hardware Setup Guide", "Configuration Manual"]}

{"concept": "What is hardware detection in NixOS?", "explanation": "[Hardware Configuration] NixOS detects hardware using: 1) systemd-udev for device management, 2) Hardware modules in the kernel, 3) Firmware detection and loading, 4) Device tree on supported platforms. Detection results are used to generate appropriate configurations.", "examples": ["Automatic detection", "Manual overrides"], "references": ["Hardware Detection Guide", "Device Management Documentation"]}

{"concept": "How do you configure storage devices?", "explanation": "[Hardware Configuration] Storage device configuration involves: 1) Defining file systems in fileSystems.*, 2) Setting up swap with swapDevices, 3) Configuring RAID or LVM if needed, 4) Managing mount options. Devices can be referenced by UUID or label.", "examples": ["Filesystem setup", "RAID configuration"], "references": ["Storage Configuration Guide", "File System Documentation"]}

{"concept": "What about graphics and display configuration?", "explanation": "[Hardware Configuration] Graphics configuration includes: 1) Video driver selection (nvidia, amd, intel), 2) Display server setup (X11, Wayland), 3) Multi-monitor configuration, 4) GPU-specific options. NixOS provides modules for major graphics hardware.", "examples": ["Graphics setup", "Multi-monitor config"], "references": ["Graphics Guide", "Display Configuration Documentation"]}

{"concept": "How do you handle network hardware?", "explanation": "[Hardware Configuration] Network hardware configuration involves: 1) Interface configuration through networking.*, 2) Driver selection and options, 3) Wireless device setup, 4) Network manager integration. NixOS supports both simple and complex networking setups.", "examples": ["Network setup", "Wireless configuration"], "references": ["Network Hardware Guide", "Interface Configuration Documentation"]}

{"concept": "What about peripheral devices?", "explanation": "[Hardware Configuration] Peripheral device support includes: 1) Input device configuration (keyboard, mouse), 2) Printer setup through CUPS, 3) Scanner configuration with SANE, 4) Bluetooth device management. Most peripherals work automatically with optional fine-tuning.", "examples": ["Printer setup", "Input device config"], "references": ["Peripheral Guide", "Device Support Documentation"]}

{"concept": "How do you configure audio hardware?", "explanation": "[Hardware Configuration] Audio configuration in NixOS involves: 1) Sound server selection (PulseAudio, PipeWire), 2) ALSA device configuration, 3) Hardware-specific options, 4) Jack audio setup if needed. Most audio hardware is automatically configured.", "examples": ["Audio setup", "PulseAudio config"], "references": ["Audio Configuration Guide", "Sound System Documentation"]}

{"concept": "What about power management?", "explanation": "[Hardware Configuration] Power management configuration includes: 1) ACPI settings, 2) CPU frequency scaling, 3) Suspend/hibernate options, 4) Battery management. NixOS provides modules for different power management scenarios.", "examples": ["Power settings", "Battery config"], "references": ["Power Management Guide", "Energy Settings Documentation"]}

{"concept": "How do you handle special hardware?", "explanation": "[Hardware Configuration] Special hardware support includes: 1) Virtualization extensions, 2) Hardware security modules, 3) Specialized input devices, 4) Custom hardware modules. NixOS can be extended to support various specialized hardware.", "examples": ["Custom hardware", "Specialized setup"], "references": ["Special Hardware Guide", "Custom Device Documentation"]}

{"concept": "What are hardware configuration best practices?", "explanation": "[Hardware Configuration] Hardware configuration best practices include: 1) Using hardware-specific modules, 2) Testing configurations before deployment, 3) Documenting custom settings, 4) Maintaining hardware-specific backups, 5) Regular updates for driver support.", "examples": ["Best practices", "Configuration management"], "references": ["Hardware Best Practices", "Configuration Guidelines"]}
