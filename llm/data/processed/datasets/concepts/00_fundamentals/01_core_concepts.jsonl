{"concept": "What is NixOS?", "explanation": "[Core Concepts] NixOS is a Linux distribution built on pure functional principles. It uses the Nix package manager and a declarative approach to system configuration, ensuring reproducible, reliable, and atomic system management. Unlike traditional Linux distributions, all system aspects are defined in configuration files and built using pure functions.", "examples": ["A complete system configuration in configuration.nix", "Atomic system updates with rollback capability"], "references": ["https://nixos.org", "NixOS Manual"]}

{"concept": "What makes NixOS unique?", "explanation": "[Core Concepts] NixOS's uniqueness comes from three core principles: 1) Pure functional package management where packages are built as pure functions, 2) Declarative system configuration where the entire system state is defined in code, and 3) Atomic updates with rollback capability. These principles eliminate common problems like dependency conflicts and system state drift.", "examples": ["Multiple versions of the same package can coexist", "System configurations are version controlled", "Failed updates never leave the system in a broken state"], "references": ["NixOS Design Principles", "Nix Package Manager Guide"]}

{"concept": "What is declarative configuration in NixOS?", "explanation": "[Core Concepts] Declarative configuration means describing your desired system state in configuration files (mainly configuration.nix) rather than issuing commands to achieve it. NixOS then ensures the system matches this description exactly. This includes everything from installed packages to system services, users, and network settings.", "examples": ["Defining system packages in configuration.nix", "Configuring services through options", "Managing user accounts declaratively"], "references": ["NixOS Configuration Manual", "Declarative Management Guide"]}

{"concept": "What is pure functional package management?", "explanation": "[Core Concepts] Pure functional package management means that packages are built as pure functions: given the same inputs (source code, dependencies, build instructions), they always produce the same output. This is achieved by isolating packages in the /nix/store with cryptographic hashes of all inputs, ensuring reproducibility and eliminating 'works on my machine' problems.", "examples": ["/nix/store/hash-firefox-version", "Building packages in isolation", "Deterministic build outputs"], "references": ["Nix Package Manager Documentation", "Pure Functional Package Management Paper"]}

{"concept": "How does NixOS handle system state?", "explanation": "[Core Concepts] NixOS manages system state through its declarative configuration system.
