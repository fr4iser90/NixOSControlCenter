{"concept": "How does NixOS handle security?", "explanation": "[System Administration] NixOS security is built on: 1) Declarative security policies, 2) Isolation through /nix/store, 3) User and service separation, 4) Secure defaults. This provides a strong security foundation.", "examples": ["Security configuration", "Policy implementation"], "references": ["Security Guide", "Policy Documentation"]}

{"concept": "What about user security?", "explanation": "[System Administration] User security involves: 1) User account management, 2) Permission controls, 3) Authentication methods, 4) Access policies. This ensures proper user isolation and access control.", "examples": ["User setup", "Permission configuration"], "references": ["User Security Guide", "Access Control Documentation"]}

{"concept": "How do you handle system hardening?", "explanation": "[System Administration] System hardening includes: 1) Service isolation, 2) Network security, 3) File system restrictions, 4) Process confinement. This reduces system attack surface.", "examples": ["Hardening steps", "Security configuration"], "references": ["Hardening Guide", "System Security Documentation"]}
