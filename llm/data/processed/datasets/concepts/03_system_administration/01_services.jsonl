{"concept": "How does NixOS manage services?", "explanation": "[System Administration] NixOS manages services through systemd, configured declaratively in configuration.nix. Services are: 1) Defined in service modules, 2) Configured through options, 3) Started/stopped automatically, 4) Monitored for health. This provides reliable service management.", "examples": ["Service definition", "Automatic management"], "references": ["Service Management Guide", "Systemd Documentation"]}

{"concept": "What is a NixOS service module?", "explanation": "[System Administration] A service module defines: 1) Service unit configuration, 2) Dependencies and requirements, 3) Environment settings, 4) Start/stop behavior. Modules make service configuration reproducible and maintainable.", "examples": ["Basic service", "Complex setup"], "references": ["Module Guide", "Service Configuration Documentation"]}

{"concept": "How do you create custom services?", "explanation": "[System Administration] Creating custom services involves: 1) Writing a systemd service unit, 2) Defining a NixOS service module, 3) Setting up dependencies, 4) Configuring environment. This enables running custom applications as services.", "examples": ["Custom service", "Unit definition"], "references": ["Custom Service Guide", "Module Creation Documentation"]}

{"concept": "What about service dependencies?", "explanation": "[System Administration] Service dependencies are managed through: 1) Requires/Wants in systemd, 2) After/Before ordering, 3) Service module dependencies, 4) Runtime dependencies. This ensures services start in the correct order.", "examples": ["Dependency setup", "Order configuration"], "references": ["Dependency Guide", "Service Ordering Documentation"]}

{"concept": "How do you monitor services?", "explanation": "[System Administration] Service monitoring includes: 1) Systemd status checks, 2) Journal log monitoring, 3) Service health checks, 4) Notification setup. This helps maintain service reliability and troubleshoot issues.", "examples": ["Status checking", "Log monitoring"], "references": ["Monitoring Guide", "Service Health Documentation"]}

{"concept": "What about service logging?", "explanation": "[System Administration] Service logging in NixOS uses: 1) Systemd journal for centralized logs, 2) Service-specific log configuration, 3) Log rotation settings, 4) Log forwarding options. This provides comprehensive service monitoring.", "examples": ["Log configuration", "Journal usage"], "references": ["Logging Guide", "Journal Documentation"]}

{"concept": "How do you handle service failures?", "explanation": "[System Administration] Service failure handling includes: 1) Restart policies, 2) Failure detection, 3) Recovery actions, 4) Notification systems. This ensures services remain available despite issues.", "examples": ["Failure recovery", "Restart configuration"], "references": ["Failure Handling Guide", "Recovery Documentation"]}

{"concept": "What are service states?", "explanation": "[System Administration] Service states in NixOS include: 1) Active/inactive status, 2) Enabled/disabled at boot, 3) Running/stopped condition, 4) Failed state handling. Understanding states is crucial for management.", "examples": ["State checking", "Status management"], "references": ["State Guide", "Status Documentation"]}

{"concept": "How do you optimize services?", "explanation": "[System Administration] Service optimization involves: 1) Resource limits configuration, 2) Performance tuning, 3) Dependency optimization, 4) Startup time improvement. This ensures efficient service operation.", "examples": ["Resource configuration", "Performance tuning"], "references": ["Optimization Guide", "Performance Documentation"]}

{"concept": "What are service best practices?", "explanation": "[System Administration] Service best practices include: 1) Minimal privilege principle, 2) Clear dependency management, 3) Proper logging setup, 4) Regular monitoring, 5) Documentation maintenance. These ensure reliable service operation.", "examples": ["Security setup", "Maintenance procedures"], "references": ["Best Practices Guide", "Service Management Documentation"]}
