{"concept": "What are Nixpkgs overlays?", "explanation": "[Package Management] Overlays are a way to extend or modify the Nixpkgs package set without changing it directly. They're pure functions that take the original package set and return a modified one. This allows for customization while maintaining reproducibility.", "examples": ["Basic overlay", "Package modification"], "references": ["Overlay Documentation", "Package Customization Guide"]}

{"concept": "How do you create an overlay?", "explanation": "[Package Management] Creating an overlay involves: 1) Writing a function that takes self and super parameters, 2) Defining package modifications or additions, 3) Placing the overlay in a .nix file, 4) Registering it in your configuration. Overlays can modify existing packages or add new ones.", "examples": ["Simple overlay", "Complex modifications"], "references": ["Overlay Creation Guide", "Function Documentation"]}

{"concept": "What are overlay layers?", "explanation": "[Package Management] Overlay layers are the order in which overlays are applied. Each overlay: 1) Sees the results of previous overlays, 2) Can override or extend previous changes, 3) Forms part of a composition chain, 4) Contributes to the final package set.", "examples": ["Layer ordering", "Override precedence"], "references": ["Layer System Documentation", "Composition Guide"]}

{"concept": "How do you use overlays in configuration?", "explanation": "[Package Management] Overlays can be used in: 1) System configuration through nixpkgs.overlays, 2) User environments via ~/.config/nixpkgs/overlays, 3) Project-specific settings in shell.nix, 4) Flake inputs. This provides flexibility in package customization.", "examples": ["System overlay", "User overlay"], "references": ["Configuration Guide", "Usage Documentation"]}

{"concept": "What are common overlay patterns?", "explanation": "[Package Management] Common overlay patterns include: 1) Version overrides for packages, 2) Patch application to existing packages, 3) Custom package collections, 4) Development versions of packages. These patterns solve various customization needs.", "examples": ["Version override", "Custom collection"], "references": ["Pattern Guide", "Best Practices Documentation"]}

{"concept": "How do you debug overlays?", "explanation": "[Package Management] Debugging overlays involves: 1) Tracing overlay application order, 2) Inspecting package definitions, 3) Testing modifications in isolation, 4) Using nix-shell for development. Tools help understand how overlays affect the package set.", "examples": ["Debug techniques", "Troubleshooting"], "references": ["Debugging Guide", "Development Tools Documentation"]}

{"concept": "What are overlay best practices?", "explanation": "[Package Management] Overlay best practices include: 1) Keeping overlays focused and minimal, 2) Documenting modifications clearly, 3) Testing changes thoroughly, 4) Managing dependencies carefully, 5) Using version control for overlays.", "examples": ["Good practices", "Common mistakes"], "references": ["Best Practices Guide", "Maintenance Documentation"]}

{"concept": "How do you share overlays?", "explanation": "[Package Management] Overlays can be shared through: 1) Git repositories, 2) NixOS modules, 3) Flake outputs, 4) Package collections. This enables reuse and collaboration on package customizations.", "examples": ["Sharing methods", "Repository structure"], "references": ["Sharing Guide", "Community Documentation"]}

{"concept": "What are overlay limitations?", "explanation": "[Package Management] Overlay limitations include: 1) Order dependency in composition, 2) Potential conflicts between overlays, 3) Complexity in large modifications, 4) Performance impact with many overlays. Understanding these helps in overlay design.", "examples": ["Common issues", "Workarounds"], "references": ["Limitations Guide", "Technical Documentation"]}

{"concept": "How do overlays interact with flakes?", "explanation": "[Package Management] Overlays in flakes: 1) Can be defined as flake outputs, 2) Are explicitly imported in flake inputs, 3) Support more precise versioning, 4) Enable better composition. Flakes provide a more structured way to manage overlays.", "examples": ["Flake integration", "Version management"], "references": ["Flake Integration Guide", "Modern Overlay Documentation"]}
